# Object Detection Projects

Here i will publish all my example projects that relate to object detection algorithms.

[**Traffic counting**](https://github.com/creotiv/object_detection_projects/tree/master/opencv_traffic_counting) - Traffic counting example based on OpencCV object detection with background subtraction.
